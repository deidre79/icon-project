    <h1>Biking South Brooklyn</h1>

    <h3>Cycling trends have increased in NYC for more than ten years, but bike network expansions have stopped short in much of South Brooklyn.</h2>

    <p>While October may evoke thoughts of dropping temperatures and ‚Äúspooky season,‚Äù bicycle enthusiasts celebrate Biketober. Led by the organization Love to Ride, Biketober is a month-long challenge encouraging people of all experience levels to ride a bike. The initiative has been adopted by several groups around the country including the NYC Department of Transportation, which hosts several ‚ÄúBike the Block‚Äù events throughout the city in October. These are pop-up events that block off a few streets to vehicles and host bike repair stations, helmet fitting booths and more.</p>
    <br>
    <p>New Yorkers have been biking more and more each year: from 2009 to 2019 there was a 116% growth in daily cycling and in 2021 an estimated 773,000 New Yorkers rode a bike regularly (ie. at least several times a month). The DOT has increased bike lanes and CitiBike continues to expand its service in the city.</p>
    <br>
    <p>However, not all neighborhoods have seen expanded bike networks. In Brooklyn CD 11 (Bensonhurst and Bath Beach) only two percent of streets have bike lanes, in contrast with Brooklyn‚Äôs bike network coverage (13% of streets have bike lanes). How might that affect movement through the neighborhood? As a case study, let's look at travel times from a local assemblyman‚Äôs office to a cafe across the neighborhood.</p>

      <p>You have two public transit options, although both require walking: walk 12 minutes and catch the B1 bus, which will drop you off right in front of the cafe. This option takes <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/William+Colton+Community+Office,+155+Kings+Hwy,+Brooklyn,+NY+11223/Coffee+Rx,+86th+Street,+Brooklyn,+NY/@40.6061401,-74.0063673,15z/am=t/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c24502def1cd15:0x3065d8bcfd6cf373!2m2!1d-73.9857045!2d40.6059673!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c2456d9d484945:0xc0950a673aa70f89!2m2!1d-74.0094476!2d40.6111882!3e3" target=blank>24 minutes</a> if you have perfect timing for the bus, which comes every 10 minutes.  The other option is to walk for 13 minutes, hop on the D train for two stops, then walk another 11 minutes to the cafe. This option also takes <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/William+Colton+Community+Office,+155+Kings+Hwy,+Brooklyn,+NY+11223/Coffee+Rx,+86th+Street,+Brooklyn,+NY/@40.6061401,-74.0063673,15z/am=t/data=!4m15!4m14!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c24502def1cd15:0x3065d8bcfd6cf373!2m2!1d-73.9857045!2d40.6059673!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c2456d9d484945:0xc0950a673aa70f89!2m2!1d-74.0094476!2d40.6111882!3e3!5i2" target=blank>24 minutes</a> if you have perfect timing for the train, which comes every 10 minutes.</p>

      <p>If you want to take the route with the most official bike lanes, the ride will take <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/William+Colton+Community+Office,+155+Kings+Hwy,+Brooklyn,+NY+11223/Coffee+Rx,+86th+Street,+Brooklyn,+NY/@40.6069465,-74.0082828,14.52z/data=!4m34!4m33!1m25!1m1!1s0x89c24502def1cd15:0x3065d8bcfd6cf373!2m2!1d-73.9857045!2d40.6059673!3m4!1m2!1d-73.9790391!2d40.6043417!3s0x89c244fcf1ffdb19:0x5d1530dc289f65f6!3m4!1m2!1d-73.9777027!2d40.5921921!3s0x89c244541eb7ff4f:0x571c01ad1e6c5bba!3m4!1m2!1d-73.9852287!2d40.5967297!3s0x89c245aa9b1d8e8d:0xfc6c34da0137c7d2!3m4!1m2!1d-73.993845!2d40.5961496!3s0x89c245a861b5cb57:0xd38260aae261b2d4!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c2456d9d484945:0xc0950a673aa70f89!2m2!1d-74.0094476!2d40.6111882!3e1!5m1!1e3" target=blank>24 minutes across 4.1 miles</a>. If you follow the guidance of Google Maps, you‚Äôll get there twice as fast with a much lower mileage: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/William+Colton+Community+Office,+155+Kings+Hwy,+Brooklyn,+NY+11223/Coffee+Rx,+86th+Street,+Brooklyn,+NY/@40.6085307,-74.0007653,15.18z/data=!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c24502def1cd15:0x3065d8bcfd6cf373!2m2!1d-73.9857045!2d40.6059673!1m5!1m1!1s0x89c2456d9d484945:0xc0950a673aa70f89!2m2!1d-74.0094476!2d40.6111882!3e1!5m1!1e3" target=blank>11 minutes across 1.6 miles</a>.</p>

      <p>Driving is the fastest way to get from point A to point B in this situation.

Many Bensonhurst residents may opt for this if they have a vehicle, which about 59.1% of whom do, according to the American Community Survey 2016-2020 (5-Year Estimate). That‚Äôs higher than the NYC average- across five boroughs, only 45.2% of people have access to a vehicle.</p>

But you may be sharing the sidewalk with some e-bikes and scooters, according to complaints at recent Community Board 11 meetings.</p>
